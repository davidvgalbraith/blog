It was the lazy Saturday after Thanksgiving, and to burn off some of the extra calories from the preceding days I decided to break into the open-source world. I'd worked with <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">node.js</a> at Jut, so I was acquainted with the platform, though I had no experience with the source code. So I wandered into the issue tracker for the node.js repository, settling on issue <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/node/issues/4049">4049</a>, a memory leak in the ChildProcess module.
<h3>ChildProcess</h3>
The <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/child_process.html">ChildProcess</a> module is a part of node.js that runs shell commands. You can run a shell command from a node process using ChildProcess.spawn(). The object returned from ChildProcess.spawn() has fields called stdout and stderr. The value of stdout is a stream from which you can read any data that the executed process calculates, and stderr is a stream from which you can read information about any errors that occur during the executed process. Here's a simple example that runs an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Echo_%28command%29">echo</a> command and logs the result:
<pre>var ChildProcess = require('child_process');

var process = ChildProcess.spawn('echo', ['hello']);

process.stdout.on('data', function(datum) {
    console.log('received datum: ', datum.toString());
});</pre>
The node.js user <a href="https://github.com/jhenninger">jhenninger</a> had found a combination of spawning processes, reading from their stdout streams, and killing the processes that caused a memory leak. A lot of my work at Jut involved running down memory leaks, so I figured I was qualified to attack this one.

The issue handily came with reproducing code. The code spawns a simple child process every 50 milliseconds, calls read() on its stdout stream, and promptly kills it. This should cause the child process to have nothing left to do, so the <a href="http://jayconrod.com/posts/55/a-tour-of-v8-garbage-collection">garbage collector</a> should free the memory allocated to it.  But this code contained some extra logic, powered by the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/weak">weak.js</a> library, that kept track of these garbage collections. This logic indicated that ChildProcess objects were not being freed. Here's the script (I added some comments and changed some variable names from the original, for clarity):
<pre>var ChildProcess = require('child_process');
var weak = require('weak'); // nifty library that lets you fire a callback when an object is garbage collected

var child_processes_in_memory = 0;

function callback() {
  console.log(child_processes_in_memory--); // one fewer process is in memory now that this one has been freed
}

setInterval(function spawnKill() {
  var p = ChildProcess.spawn('yes'); // start a process running the "yes" command

  ++child_processes_in_memory; // p is now in memory, so increment child_processes_in_memory

  p.stdout.read(); // get some data from the process (since p is running "yes" the data looks like newline separated 'y' characters)
  p.kill(); // stop the process, this should free up all the resources associated with it enabling p to be freed

  weak(p, callback); // call callback() when p is freed

  gc(); // trigger an immediate garbage collection, so p will be deallocated right here if possible

}, 50);</pre>
<h3>The game is afoot</h3>
The first step was to witness the leak on my own machine. I downloaded the node.js source code, ran the script and lo: a memory leak. Now it was time to dive into the code. I had three functions that I needed to understand before I could fix this leak: spawn, read, and kill. I decided to start with kill, because I had a hunch that was where the problem was. I tracked down ChildProcess's kill function, but it just delegated to this._handle.kill(). To figure out what that meant, I had to go back to the ChildProcess constructor, where I saw the initializer this._handle = new Process();. Process is defined by the v8 library that underlies Node. v8 is much more mature than Node, so I decided to operate for the moment under the assumption that Process was working okay, and the problem was in Node, not v8, so I didn't inspect Process's source code in any depth.

But two lines after the initialization of this._handle, I noticed the line this._handle.onexit = function(exitCode, signalCode) { ... Based on the name, I figured this would be where ChildProcess was supposed to clean up its resources after its process had been killed. The interesting part for me was this bit at the end of the function:
<pre>process.nextTick(flushStdio, self);

maybeClose(self);</pre>
The function name maybeClose suggested that that function didn't always succeed -- a process might not end up closing. To figure out under what circumstances the process wouldn't close, I went to maybeClose's definition:
<pre>function maybeClose(subprocess) {
  subprocess._closesGot++;

  if (subprocess._closesGot == subprocess._closesNeeded) {
    subprocess.emit('close', subprocess.exitCode, subprocess.signalCode);
  }
}</pre>
To interpret this, I had to find out what those _closesGot and _closesNeeded fields meant. I found their declarations in the spawn method -- _closesNeeded is initialized to 1 and incremented for each output stream associated with the process, and _closesGot is initialized to 0 and only incremented here in maybeClose. These streams are <a href="https://nodejs.org/api/events.html">EventEmitters</a>, and they emit events whenever their status changes. Clients such as ChildProcess can add "event handlers" to events emitted by streams, which are functions that will be called when a particular stream emits a particular event. ChildProcess's spawn method puts a 'close' event handler on each of its output streams, calling maybeClose in response to a 'close' event from that stream.

Since my script spawns processes without any fancy parameters, they have the default stream configuration: two output streams called this.stdout and this.stderr. So each expects three _closesGot before it will declare itself closed. These _closesGot come from the maybeClose call in this._handle.onexit plus one from each maybeClose call in response to 'close' events from stdout and stderr. I had a hunch that it wasn't getting all three.

A ChildProcess object is an EventEmitter too, and it will emit a 'close' event of its own once all its output streams have emitted 'close' events. To get a better feel for how all these close events were interacting, I wanted to trace all the events my child processes were emitting. I implemented this with some tweaks to my test script - I numbered each of my child processes, and I overwrote their emit functions with a function that logged their number and then called the normal emit function. Here's how it turned out:
<pre>var process_index = 0;

setInterval(function spawnKill() {
  var p = ChildProcess.spawn('yes'); // start a process running the "yes" command
  p.number = process_index++;
  var old_emit = p.emit; // save a reference to p's ordinary function that emits events

  p.emit = function(type) { // overwrite p's emit function
    console.log(p.number, type); // log the index of this process and the type of the emitted event
    old_emit.apply(p, arguments); // handle the event as we ordinarily would using p's original emit function
  };

  // ... rest of the script as above</pre>
Maybe I'm crazy, but I find hacks like that ridiculously beautiful. The way Javascript lets you freely manipulate your objects is one of the main reasons I love it. Anyway, running the script that way, I got to see every event that my processes were emitting, and sure enough, the ones that were never getting freed were never emitting 'close' events either. By similarly tracing the emits from stderr and stdout, I found that stdout was not always closing. This meant that p was stuck at two close events (the ones from this._handle.exit and stderr), so it never could close itself.

If I took out the call to p.stdout.read(), all of the close events always fired. So somehow my call to p.stdout.read() was preventing p.stdout from closing once I killed the process p. To figure out why, I had to check out the code for read, defined in net.js. It looks like this:
<pre>Socket.prototype.read = function(n) {
  if (n === 0)
    return stream.Readable.prototype.read.call(this, n);

  this.read = stream.Readable.prototype.read;
  this._consuming = true;
  return this.read(n);
};</pre>
All the real reading work is handled by stream.Readable.prototype.read, but first Socket.prototype.read sets this._consuming to true the first time it is called with a nonzero argument. Since I call p.stdout.read(), n is undefined, not 0. That means this._consuming does get set to true here.

The final piece of the puzzle was the flushStdio method of ChildProcess, which you may recall is the other method (besides maybeClose) that ChildProcess calls in this._handle.onexit. Here's how it looked when I found it:
<pre>function flushStdio(subprocess) {
  if (subprocess.stdio == null) return;
  subprocess.stdio.forEach(function(stream, fd, stdio) {
    if (!stream || !stream.readable || stream._consuming)
      return;
    stream.resume();
  });
}</pre>
stream.resume() is a method that tells the stream to emit any data it has buffered, then tear itself down and emit a 'close' event. That seems important. But look! We don't call it if the stream has its _consuming field set. We set our stdout's _consuming to true when we called read() on it, so flushStdio() didn't called stdout's resume(). This seemed likely to be the cause of the memory leak.
<h3>The fix</h3>
I didn't see any reason not to call resume() on streams that had _consuming true. So I replaced if (!stream || !stream.readable || stream._consuming) in the flushStdio function with if (!stream || !stream.readable) and reran the leak-generating script. Sure enough, no leak ensued! I had fixed node.js.

I'm not sure how the original broken code came into existence in the first place, but there had recently been a major refactor of how Node's streams are implemented, so I guess this slipped through the cracks.

With the mystery solved, all that remained was to get my code into production. I wrote up a little test that spawns and kills a process and wait for the close event from it, made sure it failed on the master branch and passed on my branch, and opened a pull request against node with my change and the test. The reviewers noted that my original test spawned a process using the "yes" command, which apparently doesn't work on Windows. When I changed it to the universal "echo" command, they approved my commit, and just like that I was a node.js contributor!

So that's the story of how I learned a new codebase, fixed a pretty significant bug in node.js, and made the world a better place. Not too bad for the lazy Saturday after Thanksgiving!
